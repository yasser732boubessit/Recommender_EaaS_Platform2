It seems like you want to modify or review the `RequestResponse` class. Could you clarify what changes or enhancements you need? For example:

1. Do you want to uncomment the `timestamp` field and include it in the class?
2. Are there any additional fields or methods you'd like to add?
3. Do you need help with testing or integrating this class with other parts of your application?

Let me know how I can assist!
